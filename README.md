# Love potion port for the ds baltro
A port of fire game Balatro to the nintendo DS made using MicroLUA. Then thats ported to the 2ds and 3ds with love potion and lovebrew:O
THIS IS A FORK SO ITS A BASIC PORT I WILL TRY UPDATE WITH THE OG
## How to Install
<bold> YOU NEED A HOMEBREWED 2DS OR 3DS FOR THIS PLEASE FIND A GUIDE TO HACK YOURS <bold>

1. Get love potion from https://github.com/lovebrew/lovepotion/releases/
2. Extract the zip 
3. find the 3dsx file
4. Plug your sd card into your pc or Ftp in with ftpd
5. find the 3ds folder
6. make a folder
7. put the lovepotion and copy the port over to the folder yes all the stuff

## Limits
The game lacks music, different decks, and only has 12 Boss Blinds and 15 Jokers. 

As well as the system for finding what the current hand played is can't take hands that aren't the amount of cards that the hand should be, so say in Balatro you have a pair and 3 other random cards, in the port the game wouldn't recognize that as a pair. Trust me I tried so hard to make it work but the game never would've come out if didnt take the easier method, maybe sometime in the future.
